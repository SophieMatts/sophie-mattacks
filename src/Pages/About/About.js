        <h1>My Journey so Far...</h1>
        <p>
          My working career started after leaving college with A-Levels, and wondering what on earth to do next.
          I had a place at a distinguished University, with a plan to take a degree in media production but quite frankly, I’d had enough and needed a break!
          My overall experience with school and college was an uphill battle. I got by, but I struggled with the rigid “one size fits all” approach to learning, so I thought I’d try my hand at the practical world of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I deferred my uni place for a year and in the end… I never went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that decision, I’ve had a vast variety of jobs in my working career which include being: a makeup artist, a bank cashier and cabin crew.
          That was until I fell into the world of commercial office furniture, which is where I then stayed over the next 10 years.
          I started at a showroom manager and eventually worked my way up through sales support, sales and then project managing - until the Covid-19 pandemic hit and I was furloughed for 8 months!
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing all the jigsaws I could get my hands on and making all variations of banana bread, I needed something to really sink my teeth into.
          A good friend of mine introduced me to coding, and they told me all about how creative it can be. With that, they suggested I tried an app called "Playgrounds", which is a game-based coding app, covering the fundamentals of “Swift”. As simple as it sounds, it was from that moment of playing a game that lead me into wanting to know more.
          I always thought that coding was completely above my level of understanding. However, what I know now is that coding is all about having interesting ideas and being able to solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking into things further, I was so inspired by the vast avenues and possibilities of where tech could lead me.
          So I decided to take the plunge and sign up to a part-time web development course at Le Wagon, to gain more skills and see what life as an aspiring developer was really all about. In a nutshell, the course was an extremely intense yet incredible learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since finishing the bootcamp at Le Wagon, I managed to land my first tech job in 5 months and was also accepted to become a teaching assistant on the part-time Web Development course. I did this not only to keep my Ruby/Rails skills going, but also to become a mentor for someone like myself in the future.
          I've definitely learned that being able to explain abstract theories in an understandable way is an art form and true skill! and one that I'm continuing to develop on.

        <h1>Neurodiversity...</h1>
        <p>
          In the summer of 2020, approaching my 30th birthday, I was diagnosed with combined-type ADHD.
          I’ve always felt different to a lot of people and It explained a lot of things for me. Especially the issues I’ve had in the past with mainstream education and social anxieties.
          Although ADHD is classed as a disability, there are so many amazing attributes that a lot of people don’t know about.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, my planning and organisational skills are exceptional. I’m always thinking far ahead into the future, which allows me make strong decisions and plan for eventualities for further down the line. It also allows me to have different outlooks and approaches to tasks that others might not think of - making me a natural problem solver.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always get a huge dopamine rush from finding/creating helpful solutions. One in particular was creating an ADHD App, called “Clarity”, as part of my Bootcamp final group project.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as the practical side, I’m very empathic and sensitive to myself and other people.
          I’m always thinking about how someone else might be feeling and do my best to make them feel valued and supported.

        <h1>My Vision...</h1>
        <p>
          Going forward, I want to create and contribute to projects that make a positive difference to people’s lives.
          Whether that be a learning tool to help someone understand a difficult concept, or even a fun creation to simply boost your mood and mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, I also want to become a mentor for neurodiverse people in tech, especially women.
          I want to be the person that I never had during my learning journey. Someone who can inspire and get the best out of people not only through the hard times, but through the good times as well.
